    "description": "My first experience working on a team collaboratively and my first time serving as a team leader, GymRatTrax was my senior academic project. It is a personal fitness scheduler application made to replace a fitness planner with features such as adaptive suggestions, reverse calorie search, and robust statistics. I ran weekly Kanban sprints for the team using GitHub Issues to make sure we were staying on track to meet planned milestone deadlines. This is the first Android application I have developed that has been published to the Google Play Store. In addition to leading the development, I coordinated our other tasks on the project including documentation, class presentations and deliverables, and our presentation at a public showcase event."

Click on a unit to multiply or divide by that unit. Starting with only the four basic units (e.g., kilograms, meters), can you activate the other derived units (e.g., Newtons, Joules)? See how many you can recall from memory before you look them up online. Keyboard shortcuts can also be used."
