<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Have you ever taken a shortcut to complete a task, assuring yourself that you would go back and clean it up and do it
  the right way later when you had the time? In software, this is called ‚Äútechnical debt,‚Äù and when it piles up, it can
  make code hard to read and maintain. Soon enough, the cost to fix these problems can become too high, and convincing
  your team to take action becomes increasingly difficult. In this talk, we will discuss the different types of
  technical debt, how to convince other people in the organization of the importance of making regular ‚Äúminimum
  payments,‚Äù and some creative strategies to keep in mind for software projects with excessive ‚Äúaccrued interest.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>See some basic notes from the talk below. More will be added soon.</p>
<h4>What is technical debt?</h4>
<p>Technical debt refers to the parts of our code that is outdated and imperfect, often due to having taken shortcuts.
  Teams often tell themselves that they will go back and adjust things when other priority work is complete. When this
  is not done, this affects the quality of the application significantly and becomes harder to resolve, just as a debt
  can grow and become harder to pay off.</p>
<p>Types of technical debt include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taking a lot of shortcuts</li>
  <li>Team faces too many last-minute changes</li>
  <li>Data, UI, and business logic is all combined</li>
  <li>Code is hard to read</li>
  <li>Code is scary and making changes is too risky</li>
  <li>There is no documentation</li>
  <li>There is no cross-training on the team</li>
  <li>There is no clear leadership or ownership</li>
  <li>There are no unit tests</li>
  <li>Concerns from developers are not taken into account</li>
  <li>Dependencies are outdated</li>
</ul>
