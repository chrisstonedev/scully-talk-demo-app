<h4>Speaking</h4>
<p>
  Speaking about technical topics helps me synthesize topics that I am trying to learn as well as share the things that
  I have learned with a wider audience. This is a relatively new pursuit in my career, so please come back to this page
  soon for more detail about talks I have given and the content from those talks. If you would like to invite me to
  speak at your conference, <a routerLink="/contact">please reach out to me to let me know</a>.
